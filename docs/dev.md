# Development Setup

This document describes the dev setup of the solution.

## Codespaces

GitHub [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) are fully supported by the solution.
Hence we can build and run wasm containers in the devcontainer without any dependency to the host machine by just one click:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/suneetnangia/wasm-orchestration-with-spin)

More about the docker-in-docker approach can be read in the  [Docker In Docker](#docker-in-docker) section.

## Local Dev Environment

### Prerequisites

Ensure Docker Engine or Docker Desktop is installed on your machine to create the dev container.

  <summary>Docker In Docker Alternative</summary>
  > **Note**: if there are problems with the docker-in-docker use, you can enable the ["Use Containerd for pulling and storing images"](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/containerd/) feature in the Docker Desktop settings. Accordingly, the feature to use the Docker of the host machine needs to be activated in the devcontainer.json file and the image can be referenced directly, e.g. as follows:

```json
  "name": "Ubuntu",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:jammy",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-outside-of-docker:1": {}
  },
```

</details>

## Load Dev Environment (Codespace or Local Dev Env)

Clone the repo on your local machine and open it in VS Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suneetnangia/wasm-orchestration-with-spin.git && cd wasm-orchestration-with-spin
code .
```

Repo contains the [devcontainer](../.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) setup that installs all required tools and sdks as below:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/): open source containerization technology
- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), rustup and wasm32-wasi target
- [spin](https://www.fermyon.com/spin): framework and dev tool for building WebAssembly (nano) services
- [k3d](https://k3d.io/): lightweight wrapper that runs a k3s cluster in docker
- [kubeclt](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/): Kubernetes command line tool
- [helm](https://helm.sh/): Kubernetes package manager based on helm charts
- ...

Just start the Dev Container by clicking the double-arrow icon in the bottom left corner of VS Code and select `Reopen in Container` or press `F1` and type `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.

### Deploy K3d Cluster and Workloads

#### Initial Setup

Run the `make` command in root of the repo.

This command does the following:

1. Deploys k3d cluster called **wasm-cluster** including Spin's Containerd shim on the nodes.
2. Deploys Redis-Stack as a pod, which contains Redis server and web UI.
3. Deploys workload apps which demonstrate a simple asynchronous order process.
4. Forwards ports to the host machine to allow http endpoints of apps (port 8002) and Redis-Stack UX (port 8001) can be accessed via localhost.

##### (optionally) Single Spin App Change Loop

Follow these steps to test your changes quickly, when you make iterative changes to Spin apps:

1. Increment the version in the spin.toml in the app folder, e.g. `apps/orderprocessor/spin.toml`
2. Run the `make` command in the app folder, e.g. `apps/orderprocessor`.

We read the version from the spin.toml file, update the deploy.yaml and use this version as new image tag for the Spin app that is going to be imported and deployed into the k3d cluster.

#### Test the Sample Workloads (`Make Test` coming soon)

Test the sample solution **from the host machine** as follows:

- Post New Order:

  POST/[http://localhost:8002/order](http://localhost:8002/order)

```json
  {
    "details": "Your order"
  }
```

  or `curl -d '{"details":"your order"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8002/order`

  It returns a 202 accepted response with status as _created_, auto generated orderId (id below) and the relative url for the status request endpoint, as below:

```json
  {
    "task":{
      "href":"/order/434536",
      "id":434536,
      "status":"created"
      }
  }
```

- Get Status:
  GET/[http://localhost:8002/order/\<orderId>](http://localhost:8002/order/<orderId>)
  
  or `curl http://localhost:8002/order/<orderId>`
  
  Once the order has been processed by the Fulfilment Processor app (a wasm component in Spin), the status changes to _fulfilled_ and that is returned in the response message, as below:
  
```json
  {
    "id": "434536",
    "status": "fulfilled"
  }
```

> you can open the redis-stack dashboard in the browser via [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) to see how the message is being processed by the apps.

## Docker-In-Docker

The solution requires the ["Use Containerd for pulling and storing images"](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/containerd/) feature to build images with the wasi/wasm platform target. This feature can be either enbled in Docker Desktop settings or by applying the docker-in-docker approach that makes use of the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) and configuration in the /etc/docker/daemon.json file.
The current implementation uses a Dockerfile in the devcontainer.json where it calls setup scripts to install and starts the docker engine while container creation process.
This pattern aligns with the official recommendation in the devcontainer feature [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/blob/main/script-library/docs/docker-in-docker.md) and as it is outlined in the [sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/docker-in-docker). Minor adjustments are added to configure the right parameter set and to copy the daemon.json file into the container.

> **Note**: we do NOT install Docker Compose. If this might be of any relevance and required at a later time, it can be easily added to the installation script as described in the official [Docker Compose install guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) by adding:

```bash
apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends docker-compose-plugin
```
